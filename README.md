*NETHACK 3.4.3+*

I'm making my copy of nethack available for others to see. The branch [CursesUTF8](https://github.com/jtmcdole/NetHack/tree/CursesUTF8) 
is probably what you are looking for as it contains the ncrusesw + utf8graphics patch to vanilla.

Update: synced with all nethack.atl.org patches!
